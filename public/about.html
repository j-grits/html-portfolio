<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Enthusiastic and detail-oriented Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience
  in developing dynamic web applications through a comprehensive full-stack
  bootcamp and a practical internship. Skilled in modern JavaScript frameworks,
  backend development, and cloud services. Eager to apply technical expertise
  and passion for software development in a collaborative team environment.

<p>
  In my previous roles, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
  related technologies like React, Typescript, Node.js, Next.js, and PostgreSQL.
  This exposure has only increased my desire to deepen my knowledge. With a
  solid foundation in programming practices, data algorithms, server
  architecture, and object-oriented programming, I am equipped to deliver
  effective and scalable solutions at every part of the software development
  life cycle.

<p>
  My approach to problem-solving is meticulous and I take pride in writing
  clean, reliable code. I understand the importance of balancing fast-paced
  development with quality outcomes. Continuous learning is at the heart of who
  I am as a developer so I take initiative to continuously expand my technical
  knowledge and refine my skills. My combination of technical expertise and
  strong soft skills enables me to adapt and thrive in diverse environments. I
  am solution-oriented and dedicated to delivering results that drive positive
  business outcomes while prioritizing user needs and product goals. I donâ€™t
  just view myself as a coder who can problem-solve, but rather as a
  problem-solver who can code. Being able to zoom in to a small problem and find
  a solution while keeping the big picture in mind allows me to anticipate
  potential problems and develop pragmatic, cohesive and well-rounded solutions.
